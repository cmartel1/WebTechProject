        <iframe id="harvardvideo" width="345" height="222" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bt1SIIe8s5I" title="Asking Harvard Students If They Ever Sleep" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>       <p id="details-harvard">The latest video published on my channel was filmed on Thursday, October 28th, 2021. The initial filming date was Sunday, October 24th but, after 3 hours on campus at Harvard University, I lacked the confidence to interact with strangers and ask for interviews. I only asked one person, but he was not a student. Rather than feeling discouraged, this failure lit a flame, and I became driven to overcome the insecurity and pursue my dream of being a video creator. So, I asked my friend Kevin to film again with me, and he offered a one hour time slot that Thursday. Once stepping foot on campus, I didn't hesitate to ask for an interview. The first group rejected me, but one minute later, another group accepted, as did the third group. With their responses, I packaged the footage into this six minute video, which now has been viewed nearly 5 million times.</p>
        <h2 id="scaryvideo">My Scariest Video to Film</h2>
        <iframe id="pennyvideo" width="345" height="222" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mXU93phwuY" title="Turning $0.01 into $1,000 for Ryan Trahan" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p id="details-scary">In this video, I attempted to raise $1,000 at York Beach, with only a penny and my personality. I was able to buy a water bottle for a penny, sell it for $5, then buy post cards that sold for nearly $20. With that, I bought a joke book and sold jokes for donations, then later bought crayons and paper to make a sign that read, "dares for dollars." A group of middle schoolers dared me to beat a stranger in a basketball game for $7. This was by far the most awkward and insecure I felt filming a video. It was inspired by Ryan Trahan, who makes it look so easy. Although I approach a stranger within the first 30 seconds of the video, in reality, it took multiple hours to build the courage. Although for a great cause, it was particularly straining to request money from strangers, while I was previously accustomed to giving money away.</p>
